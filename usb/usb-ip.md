## USB/IP on Android

- "USB/IP Server" is an Android app
    * Open-source (GPL v3.0), beta 0.2, last commit 2014, last checked 2021-04
    * [GitHub repo][usbipserver-github] `[saved:@cgutman__USBIPServerForAndroid]`
    * [Play Store page][usbipserver-play]

[usbipserver-github]: https://github.com/cgutman/USBIPServerForAndroid
[usbipserver-play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cgutman.usbipserverforandroid


### Personally Tested

I have personally tested it with:

- Operating systems:
  * Server: Android Go 8.1
  * Client: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x64

- Devices:
    * Mouse (details ???)
    * Keyboard (details ???)
    * Gamepad (details ???)
    * Flash drive (details ???)


In order to have an easy and a stable access to the "server" (my phone),
I've added a DHCP reservation (in my router) for my Android device:
`<Android phone MAC address> | 192.168.1.42`

Why 42?
  * Anrakki is 42
  * Anhappi is 4
  * PS: Both 4 and 42 are unhappy numbers (in math), as well as unlucky in Japanese culture.

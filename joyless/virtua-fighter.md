- ANN linked to Spacetoon Go as the Arabic internet publisher.

- See the [trailer on MAL][virtua-fighter-mal] or the OPs on the official YouTube channels of RetroCrush (in Japanese) and Spacetoon (in Arabic):
    * [Japanese opening - RetroCrush | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw3bQp-l8Jo)
    * [Arabic opening - Spacetoon | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcrSBmF9zh4)

- Spacetoon Go is $5 per month for the Pro subscription.
    * [ ] Maybe try Spacetoon Go Free and if you like it, buy it for a month to rewatch the old animes.
    * [ ] Maybe ask r/arabs: What was censored from the Arabic dub?

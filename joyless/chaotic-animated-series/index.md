(lit. _World of Chaos_) / **Chaotic**.

About the series I watched as a child (Arabic dubbed on MBC3)...

One day, it just came to my mind and I had to try to find it...

I googled the premise of the cartoon as I remembered it, and this is what I got:
> ![Google Search results, first hit: "Chaotic (TV series) - Wikipedia"](./2020-11-04_chaotic-google-search.png)
> Google Search results for "players scan monsters and embody them in battles"

- Turned out it's based on a card game and had an online version, sounded awesome.
There was an online video game as well.

- Interesting and informative video by Negative Legend: [What Happened to Chaotic](https://youtu.be/olplAC3Pkno)
